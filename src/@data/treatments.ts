        <h1>WHAT IS A HYDRAFACIAL</h1>

            <p>HydraFacial is the latest non-invasive skin resurfacing treatment using patented technology. It combines deep cleansing, exfoliation, extraction, hydration (with hyaluronic acid) and powerful antioxidant protection, as well as using red LED light in the final stage to stimulate collagen and elastin production (or where appropriate, blue LED Light which is antibacterial to treat acne). For the optimum results, we recommend a course of treatments, but after only one treatment you will notice that your skin feels firm, plump and that people comment on your healthy glow.</p>

            <p>This treatment is a favourite with celebrities and skin care professionals because it is soothing, nourishing, non-invasive and gives instant results. This is the perfect choice if you want to look radiant for a special occasion, a red carpet event and for brides-to-be.</p>

            <p>A HydraFacial is a treatment that is ideal for congested skin and everyone can have, both men and women.  The great news is that because it restores and rebuilds the health of the skin it will give everybody an immediate visible improvement and what's more the treatment can be tailored to treat any specific skin concerns you may have.</p>

            <h2>Why have a HydraFacial?</h2>

            <p>1. Effective for every skin type</p>
            <p>2. Immediate visible results</p>
            <p>3. No Downtime and no discomfort</p>
            <p>4. Addresses specific skin concerns</p>
            <p>5. The most powerful non-invasive procedure</p>
            <p>6. Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</p>
            <p>7. HydraFacial uses patented technology to cleanse extract and hydrate</p>
            <p>8. Gives skin health for life with regular use</p>

            <h2>How does a HydraFacial work?</h2>

            <p>A HydraFacial is a machine with a handheld device that uses four different tips and various skin care solutions to treat your skin concerns (chemical exfoliants, antioxidants, and hydrating serums like hyaluronic acid).  The HydraFacial vacuum technology creates a vortex effect to easily dislodge and remove impurities while simultaneously introducing solutions that exfoliate, hydrate and infuse your skin with antioxidants.</p>
